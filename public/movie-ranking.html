<h3>1.The woman king</h3>
<P>I totally loved the way women were potrayed as strong undefeatable warriors and it sent chills down my spine and made me want to do better as a woman</P>
<h3>2.Black widow</h3>
<p>yup!!.. im all about woman empowerment.i love seeing women embodying action roles in a movie..this one was nothing short of exhilarating ,it kind of reminded me of "charlies angels"</p>
<h3>3.The office</h3>
<p>This is my favourite comedy series.whenever you hear me laughing so loudly in my room, this is the reason why.</p>
